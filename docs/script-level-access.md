## Script-level Access via GDAL

The Geospatial Data Abstraction Library ([GDAL](http://gdal.org/)) WMS driver supports several internal 'minidrivers' that allow access to different web mapping services. Each of these services may support a different set of options in the Service block. Documentation for these minidrivers can be found [here](http://www.gdal.org/frmt_wms.html) on the GDAL website. Two of these minidrivers in particular can be used by users to download GIBS imagery programmatically. They are the Tile Map Specification (TMS) and the OnEarth Tiled WMS (TiledWMS) minidrivers. For more information and examples regarding interacting with the GIBS API through these GDAL minidrivers, refer to our [Map Library Usage](http://127.0.0.1:8000/map-library-usage/#gdal-basic) page.
